	<h1>Alex Omid-Zohoor</h1>
	<p>
		I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span>, with a focus on analog circuit design. I grew up in Portland, Oregon, but moved to the Bay Area in 2006 to attend <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span> as an undergrad. I completed my B.S. in 2010 and my M.S. in 2011, both in Electrical Engineering. In the summer of 2010, I interned at Qualcomm in San Diego, where I did board level design for the Product and Test groups.

		In my time at <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span>, I have been fortunate to have been advised by Professor Roger Howe, Professor Bob Dutton, and Professor Boris Murmann. I am currently working on advancing the state of the art--which is currently rather basic--of analog circuits designed in an Organic Semiconductor process. I'm also lucky to serve as the EE Undergraduate Advisor, where I get to interact with current EE undergrads and help them navigate the major and other EE related topics.
